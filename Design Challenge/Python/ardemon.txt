hardware aspects:
- uses: oled, button, LED, accelerometer, motor, HR monitor
- pedometer/detect steps
- detect finger taps on accelerometer 
- ability to detect tilts to right/left
- detect throwing using accelerometer
- ability to buzz motor for specified time duration
- send HR data to serial as well

software aspects:
- game:
	- as this is a prototype we are making, ALL data will be stored on python end to make it easier
	- Each serial connection is given a set of dummy pokemon which can be leveled up by walking
	- after certain step thresholds are met, random pokemon spawns and can be collected by user
	- class structure: 
		- generic pokemon
			- inherited by class for type of pokemon
				- inherited by class for specific pokemon
	- fighting: user can select from a given moveset, player who depletes enemies' HP completely first wins
		- gains a certain XP which can go towards maybe leveling up? unimportant feature, TO-DO
	- can pet/wave at pokemon to increase friendship, which can increase crit rate/accuracy of something
		- use heart rate monitor for this

playing the game:
	- thought: unlock the game by using HR sensor to detect your specific heart beat (heart beats have unique patterns. This added functionality can be a fallback if they don't think we are addressing a specific problem).
	- tilt the device left/right to cycle between pokemon
		- also use to cycle between pokemon attacks when fighting
	- throw to collect new pokemon, or to do an attack (depends on situation).
		- if pokemon detected: catching a pokemon
		- battle: attack 
	- finger tap on accelerometer used to select/deselect pokemon
		- button, accelerometer tap, tilt, HR monitor
	- button used to lock device (turn off). Can only be unlocked with heart sensor
	- when any events happen, buzz motor for half a second
	- light led to show color of pokemon type
	- oled: display pokemon information, steps
